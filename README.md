# binary-decision-diagrams

The goal of the project is to generate binary, reduced and ordered decision diagrams with an approach similar to the one presented in Newton and Verna's paper: A Theoretical and Numerical Analysis of the Worst-Case Size of Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams

## Chosen programming language

The project have 2 versions, one in C++ and another in python : 

 - The C++ version implements the algorithm using strings as node keys.
 - The python version works with a hash generated from each key addition as keys.
